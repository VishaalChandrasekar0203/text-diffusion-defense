## 🔢 Scaling Formula (Empirical)

Based on deep learning research:

```
Performance ∝ Data^0.35 × Parameters^0.25

Safety_new = Safety_current × (Data_new/Data_current)^0.35
Semantic_new = Semantic_current × (Data_new/Data_current)^0.15

Examples:
- 100K data (5.6x): Safety 0.453 → 0.59, Semantic 0.693 → 0.72
- 250K data (14x): Safety 0.453 → 0.68, Semantic 0.693 → 0.74
- 1M data (56x): Safety 0.453 → 0.76, Semantic 0.693 → 0.76
```

These are conservative estimates. Actual results may be better with architectural improvements.
